Idea to just try hard mode now that base is complete - start small and then if I can get that to work try more.  Start with just single digit numbers allowed to be clicked
- [x] Make buttons for 2 numbers 
- [x] Addition button.
- [x] Equal button.
- [x] click handlers - to give a value of that number.
- [x] function to store clicked button into an object constructor
- [x] POST, GET
